# Moonshooters

This was a project I made as part of a coding test for a job interview. The premise was simple: build a classic SHMUP that had a basic loop and a high score board.

The project should be run in portrait mode, or else the autolayout will likely break.

Everything has been committed in a single push because the original repository was unfortunately lost.
