# Moonshooters

This was a project I made as part of a coding test for a job interview. The premise was simple: build a classic SHMUP that had a basic loop and a high score board.

The project should be run in portrait mode, or else the autolayout will likely break.

# Features

- Selectable player ships with different visuals and characterisitcs
- Different enemies with their own shot patterns and wave deployments
- Story mode which is identical every time, and features a dynamic scrolling background and a boss fight
- Endless mode that spawns enemy waves until the player exhausts their lives
- High score board which tracks scores from both story and endless mode
